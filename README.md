# README

This repository contains the **Python code** and **dataset** associated with our journal article. It provides the scripts used for data processing, training machine learning models, and evaluating their performance. Additionally, it includes the specific case study dataset (`concrete.csv`) analyzed in the paper.

The materials here enable readers to reproduce, validate, and further explore the methods and results presented in our article.


## Usage
1. **Clone** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CHPC-UT/ConcreteML.git

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Add your dataset file (e.g., `concrete.csv`) to the appropriate directory.

4. Configure the scripts as needed:
   - Modify the paths to the dataset in the code files.
   - Adjust any parameters or settings as required for your specific use case.
5. Run the scripts to see the results
